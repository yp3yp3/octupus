Hi


Please advise when you will answer all questioner.
If you use CHAT GPT or other AI please write that.


Exercise 1
You need to provision a new Web application
This is a simple “hello world” with a little apples :) page
The architecture should include : NodeJS, MongoDB, Containers.
The runtime should be on any Linux distro you prefer
Every component of the architecture should run in its own container
All the architecture should be fully defined by scripts and code (IaC) saved in github
The DB should contain this data: [ { "_id": 1, "name": "apples", "qty": 5, "rating": 3 }, { "_id": 2, "name": "bananas", "qty": 7, "rating": 1, "microsieverts": 0.1 }, { "_id": 3, "name": "oranges", "qty": 6, "rating": 2 }, { "_id": 4, "name": "avocados", "qty": 3, "rating": 5 }, ]
The exercise submission should be a git repo with all the scripts and automation code to provision the architecture.
The exercise will be checked by running the scripts in the submitted repo.
Tests that the exercise should pass:
Provision from scratch of the entire architecture
The html page returns the number of apples in the DB
Visual demonstartion of the architecure (containers, netwrok topology etc..)
Bonus
Full ci/cd pipeline with one of the cloud providers
Readme page in the git repo with guid that explains about the app, architecture design etc..
Load balancer
Your own ideas will be welcome - create a PULL REQUEST to this branch:)
At the end of the exercise you will be asked about the architecture design and the components to demonstrate your ability to learn and understand new areas and technology.
